# File Line Reference

When taking the CS5010 Program Design Paradigms, referencing line numbers and the function name in a file for the report questions is such a tedious chore. So I created this extension to accelerate the process a little bit. Hopefully, you will find it useful too.

## Usage

- Copy the file name with selected line numbers: `alt + y` (Windows) or `ctrl + y` (macOS)
- Copy the file name with selected line numbers and possibly function name: `alt + u` (Windows) or `ctrl + u` (macOS)

## Limitations

1. Copying function name only works for Java currently.
